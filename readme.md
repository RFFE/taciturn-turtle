## Don't edit anything in the dist folder!

Grunt is already configured to build to `/dist`. Feel free to enhance
`Gruntfile.js` with more or diffrent tasks so long as the end result of
deploying `/dist` still works.

## Primary Objective

Match the images provided in the directions folder to the best of your
ability in the time alloted.

## Secondary Objective

Wow us with the elegance of your source code. Feel free to use 3rd party
scripts if you like.
